> TODO: The text below is not accurate for now. It just shows what is planned.

The tool for speeding up computing by using distributed computing over a computer network. The main goal is to speed up compilation of source code, but it can be also used for other tasks.

It provides infrastructure, but actual logic how jobs are interpreted and send to remote nodes is defined by the user in form of JavaScript code. The project contains samples for distributed C/C++ compilation using GCC/Clang and for distributed 3D rendering.
